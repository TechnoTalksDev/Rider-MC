# Update: Febuary 10th 2022
Hi! If you've been monitoring this plugin then youll probabbly noticed the decline of updates and the termination of support. Though, I hope to be reversing those two today. I owe a little bit of explanation...
## Why it happend
I got overwhelmed with things that were going on in my life and just had to take a break. So, I stopped updating and being active on my plugins.
## What's next?
I've got another project that I would like to get up and running which is the discord bot I've been working on, [Reko](https://github.com/TechnoTalksDev/Reko). Once I'm able to get a stable beta release out and am satisfied then I'll be back to my plugins.
The first things I'll be doing is bug fixes and updating to version 1.18. This will hopefully make the plugin a little bit more "functional". I will probably be doing this for the first couple months. After that It depends on my future situation.
Thanks for your support and I hope **Rider** has been fun for you all!
